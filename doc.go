/*
Package cmdy is a minimalistic library for implementing CLI programs.

cmdy combines the features I like from the `flag` stdlib package with the
features I like from https://github.com/google/subcommands.

cmdy focuses on minimalism and tries to imitate and leverage the stdlib as
much as possible. It does not attempt to replace `flag.Flag`, though it does
extend it slightly.
