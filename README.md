cmdy: Go library for implementing CLI programs
==============================================

Combines the features I like from the `flag` stdlib package with the features
I like from https://github.com/google/subcommands.

This is a very early pass of basic functionality, it is not even remotely close
to what I'm aiming for, but it's a start.

Please don't use this yet.
