Definitely:
- Hidden flags (separate hide functionality for invocation and usage)
- Configurable invocation overflow (when '--flag=<v>' becomes '[options]')
- Reformat flags. Go's default output is ugly and confuses users.
- Optional grouped flags in help message.

Wishlist:
- Completion helpers
- Enumerate flags, when invalid flag detected for child command but detected in parent, offer help.
- Wrappable invocation (what did I mean by this again?)
